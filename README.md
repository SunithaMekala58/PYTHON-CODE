##  PYTHON
# Overview
* This repository showcases my hands-on practice with basic Python coding and key libraries for data analysis and visualization.
* The focus is on demonstrating proficiency with Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn through practical exercises, data manipulation etc.,

# Libraries and Tools:
* Python: The primary programming language used for all the exercises and projects.
* Numpy: For numerical computing, array operations, and mathematical functions.
* Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis of structured data (e.g., working with DataFrames).
* Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
* Seaborn: For advanced statistical data visualization, building upon Matplotlib with higher-level functions.
